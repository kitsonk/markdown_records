# An Example Markdown File

With some content here.

## A Heading at Level 2

Some more content that breaks across lines but is still a single paragraph. Some
more content that breaks across lines but is still a single paragraph.

```ts
/**
 * With a code example inline
 */

import * as lib from "https://example.com/lib.ts";

console.log(lib);
```

As well as another example here, which just uses indentation:

    console.log("hello world");

## Another Level 2 heading

With some content.

### A Level 3 heading with some `backticks`

#### A level 4 heading

With some content.

### Back Out to Level 3

And even more content, and another:

```json
{
  "code": "example"
}
```

## And finally level 2

Which is where we will end this.
